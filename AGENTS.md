# Jjdag Agent Documentation

This is a list of instructions to correct common mistakes / misconceptions agents tend to have about the codebase.

**To agents**: if anything you find in the codebase confuses you, or takes a long time to figure out, add it to the list.

## Instructions

- use jujutsu's cli help commands to look at what commands can and cannot do, what arguments they accept, what sub-commands they have, and how they work, before implementing the equivalent in the TUI
