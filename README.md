# jjdag

![](screenshot.png)

A Rust TUI to manipulate the [Jujutsu](https://github.com/jj-vcs/jj) DAG.

Inspired by the great UX of [Magit](https://magit.vc/).

Very much a work in progress, consider this a pre-alpha release. But I already use it personally for almost all jj operations.

Once you run the program you can press `?` to show the help info. Most of the commands you can see by running `jj help` in the terminal are implemented.

## Features

- Browse the jj log tree with dynamic folding/unfolding of commits and file diffs.
- Multi-key command sequences with transient-menu style help popups. For example type `gpa` to run `jj git push --all`, or `gpt` to run `jj git push --tracked`, or `ss` to squash the selected revision into its parent.
- Output from jj commands is displayed in the bottom panel.
- Mouse support: left click to select, right click to toggle folding, and scroll wheel to scroll.
